\section{ODE Integration}

\subsection{Event Detection}
The \texttt{odeint\_allroutines} interface supports optional root detection.
Provide an \texttt{ode\_event\_t} instance with an event function
$g(x, y)$ and the number of events. Events trigger on sign changes of
$g$ over an accepted step. Direction filtering is controlled with
\texttt{rootdir} values of $-1$ falling, $0$ both, or $+1$ rising. If
\texttt{terminal(i)} is set, the integrator returns at the root and the
solution is provided at the event location.
