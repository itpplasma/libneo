\section{Debug}
Parameters, variables and subroutines/functions intended for debuging.

One of the main purposes of this module is it, to provide some namelist
variables for debuging.
Intended usage is, to use these in code that one wants to check, e.g.
for index of an array to inspect, and so to allow to change this without
needing to recompile the code everytime.
