\chapter{Building libneo}

Libneo commes with cmake configuration files for building the libary.
Note that these are configured for out-of-source build, which means you
have to build in a seperate directory.
We suggest you create a subdirectory Build-Release and/or Build-Debug
for this purpose.
Inside this directory run ``cmake'' and then ``make''.
Per default this will create a shard libary. To be able to use it, it
must be found by your operating system. This can either be achivied by
adding the directory where it is located to the search path, or by
copying library and module file to a place that is already in the search
path.
