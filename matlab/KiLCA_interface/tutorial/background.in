#Comments:
if plasma profiles are steep at r=0 (their derivatives are not zero) then dPhi0 is not zero at r=0
what leads to a singular oscillaltions in the f0 moments.

For the low frequency (< 1kHz) computations it is advantageous to use a moving frame.
The wave frequency in a moving frame is om' = om - kz*V_gal_sys, kz=n/rtor, n - toroidal number.
Usually the frequency is fixed in the lab frame (flab = om/2/pi),
so we recalculate the frequency om' in the moving frame in the code for each n harmonic.
