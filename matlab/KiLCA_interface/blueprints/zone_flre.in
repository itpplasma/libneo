#Description of the zone:

#Solution space out settings:

#Collisions model settings:
1                   #collisions model for ions:      0 - (N) = const, 1 - (n, E) = const, 2 - (N, P) = const, 3 - (N, P, E) = const, where N - number, E - energy, P - momentum
1                   #collisions model for electrons: 0 - (N) = const, 1 - (n, E) = const, 2 - (N, P) = const, 3 - (N, P, E) = const, where N - number, E - energy, P - momentum

#Comments:
if flag for debugging mode is 1 then additional checks are performed in the code,
if it is 2 then additional checks are made, if 0 - no checks.

controlling factor for ONS is rather important parameter, default values are good only for the N=1 order,
for higher orders of FLRE it might be neccesary to decrease it up to 3.0 or so and also increase
accuracy of integration up to 1.0e-12. The quality of the solution can be checked by inspection of
bp.dat file - the solution must be SMOOTH! The file poy_test_err.dat is also useful.
