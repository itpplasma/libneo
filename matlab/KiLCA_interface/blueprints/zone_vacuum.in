#Description of the zone:
3.0         #r1 - minimum radius of the zone (plasma radius)
center	#type of BC at r1 (center, infinity, interface, antenna)
vacuum 		#type of the plasma model (vacuum, medium, imhd, rmhd, flre)
0			#code version for the model
interface	#type of BC at r2 (center, infinity, interface, antenna)
67.0         #r2 - maximum radius of the zone (first wall boundary)
