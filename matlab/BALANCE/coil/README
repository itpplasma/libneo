The coil currents in 33133 are as follows:

Bu (upper ring, coils 1-8):
- + + - - + + -

Bl (lower ring, coils 1-8):
+ + - - + + - - 

Coils are numbered in mathematically positive sense (CCW) as viewn from the top of the machine.

Coil current is |I_MP| ~ 1.25 kA in all coils (to be multiplied with 5 turns of each winding).

The above phasing is Delta Phi=90 degrees, the best coupling to amplifying edge kink-peeling modes for this plasma configuration. Field alignment would be at about Delta Phi = 30 degrees.
