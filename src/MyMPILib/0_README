1. Copy the file
   ProjectConfig.cmake.sample
   to
   ProjectConfig.cmake.in
   and edit the file for custom settings.

2. Have a look at the file
   CMakeLists.txt
   to understand how the project is built.

3. Enter the directory 
   Build-Release
   and run
   cmake ..
   (The two dots are required to do an out-of-source build)

4. Run
   make && make install
   to build an install the project.

The out-of-source build method gives to ability to create new build directories for different compilers and configurations, without affecting other build configurations.
The compiler can be change in step 3 by running
cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort ..
instead of
cmake ..
