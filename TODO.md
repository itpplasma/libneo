# TODO

## VMEC migration
- [ ] Update SIMPLE to consume the refactored VMEC modules (keep canonical helpers in SIMPLE).
- [ ] Add regression coverage for `vmec_field_cylindrical` (ctest + simple Python smoke).
- [ ] Document the new modules in `doc/` and cross-link the build instructions.

## ASCOT5 follow-up (`feature/ascot5-stack`)
- [ ] Restore the Python ASCOT5 adapters/tests once the stacked PR lands.
- [ ] Ensure `_magfie` exports stay compatible with the ASCOT5 helpers.
